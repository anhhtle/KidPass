#Intro

Hello,

My name is Anh Le, I am an aspiring Web Developer. I don't profess to be a Designer, though I would like to make a suggestion to your website in place of a standard application for your Junior Software Engineer position.

##KidPass suggestion

The main image in KidPass's blog (https://blog.kidpass.com/) does not cover the width of it's container if the screen's width is wide. This causes some awkward white space with the text box.

If you change the image's CSS from "max-width" to "width", this will solves it without affecting the site's responsiveness.
